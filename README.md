1. Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic condition marked by elevated blood glucose levels, leading to serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and vision loss. As of 2014, over 422 million individuals were affected globally. Contributing factors include aging, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles. Early diagnosis and effective management are essential. Machine learning offers promising tools to enhance diabetes detection and treatment by identifying complex patterns in health data.

2. Problem Statement

Despite advancements in healthcare, diabetes remains challenging to diagnose and manage. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on limited clinical indicators and self-reported information, which can result in delayed or inaccurate diagnoses. Managing diabetes also requires continuous monitoring of multiple variables, making it difficult for both patients and clinicians to maintain optimal care.

3. Objective

This project aims to address these challenges by utilizing machine learning classification techniques on the Diabetes Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set). Specifically, the project seeks to achieve the following objectives:

1. Develop machine learning models that can accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health parameters in the dataset.
2. Optimize model performance to achieve high accuracy, precision, recall, and overall diagnostic reliability.
3. Provide healthcare practitioners with advanced analytics and insights derived from the dataset to support informed clinical decision-making.
